	<title>Doug Schaefer: The Journey to a “New Eclipse CDT”</title>

	<description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/756/1*mwdMRl-nYsZ3eQ_NRvfDRw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse CDT project has been around for a long time. The first code commits were in June 2002 when QNX contributed the core C/C++ tooling components of it’s fresh new Momentics IDE. For the time it was quite visionary. Platform vendors are more often focused on their platforms and provide tools as an enabler for developers to leverage the power of those platforms. Having every company replicate that effort only leads to poor tools and unhappy developers. It doesn’t scale. Why not join together with like-minded vendors and build something we can all benefit from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, we end up with a standard platform that allows developers to work with multiple environments on the same platform leading to some interesting partnership opportunities. At the very least developers acquire skills working with that IDE they can take to other jobs or even other projects in the same company. It truly is a win/win for everyone and makes for a very rich ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all long lasting projects, it has had it’s ebbs and flows. As we started, QNX and my team at Rational Software (later part of IBM) were the main contributors. There were a few others lurking around with a few contributions. The first few monthly CDT conference calls were cool as new voices appeared from around the world. It was a great start that led to the first EclipseCon where we had people standing in the hall trying to listen into our overflow birds of a feather session. We were overwhelmed by the interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t last forever and the powers that be decided my team at IBM was needed elsewhere in the company. Obviously I wasn’t pleased and certainly wasn’t ready to leave the community. So when Sebastien Marineau, the CDT project lead at the time suggested I come work for him at QNX, I jumped at the chance. It wasn’t the easiest of moves but it was my chance to do what I could to help keep the CDT machine rolling and ended up getting a good start on my pride and joy, CDT’s super-fast indexer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the first CDT summit held in the fall of 2005 shortly after I had joined QNX, we had a lot of interest and it was well attended with over a dozen vendors present. We had some good presentations on what we were working on and some interesting presentations from other vendors on what they’d like to see in the project. Well someone said the wrong thing and I had to stop the proceedings. Of the 20 or so people in the room I asked the active contributors to stand up. There were four of us. How are they expecting this little team to do their bidding when the whole idea was to share in the effort and do something great together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s probably the proudest and hardest moment of my time on the CDT. It worked. And from the chart above you can see we had healthy growth and lots of vendors coming to help after that. Those were the best years for the project. Though for me personally, I never really did recover from my lost team at Rational/IBM and ended up moving around a bit, never leaving the CDT project but not really giving it my all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily and happily, for the last four years, I’ve been back at QNX working on that original Momentics IDE and contributing to Eclipse trying to make it easier to use for C/C++ developers including my favorite add, the Launch Bar. Our customers are happy, the community seems happy, and there are more and more vendors delivering product based on our work in open source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But also from the chart you can see participation in the CDT has been on a worrying trajectory to a point where we once again have about 4 people actively working on it. Despite being as popular as ever, only a small percentage of people and companies out there are helping with the common cause. It’s made me sad, and frankly angry. And I must apologize to my friends at last year’s EclipseCon for losing control of that a bit, but when you have so many companies leveraging something you are passionately doing for free for them, thanks to my sympathetic employer, you feel taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the leader of the project, it’s up to me with the help of my open source colleagues to find a way to turn that around. And we have some ideas that I’m very excited about. My next few posts will talk about that and go into details of some very cool new efforts underway in the CDT project. The IDE world has changed but it’s needed more than ever and we are ready to adapt. We really hope you can join us and make it great, again…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=3855ec52334&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>N4JS: Automated rename refactoring in N4JS IDE</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7569987920628430132.post-2530662466762609742</guid>
	<link>https://n4js.blogspot.com/2019/03/automated-rename-refactoring-in-n4js.html</link>
	<description>Refactoring is probably one of the most important tools for us, software developers since we constantly need to change the structure of the code to improve the code quality or to prepare the code for new features etc. The most used refactoring operation is arguably &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;rename refactoring&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Find and replace could be used for renaming but the risk of renaming unrelated names is pretty high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N4JS IDE provides a powerful way of automatically renaming a definition and all its references with a comparable user experience as rename refactoring of Eclipse Java Development Tool (JDT).  The slogan is: &lt;i&gt;I want to rename this thing, do it for me however you like but please in a safe manner so that I can move on! &lt;/i&gt;This will exactly be your experience with rename refactoring in N4JS IDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple rename example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Let's have look at a simple example to see how rename refactoring works in N4JS IDE in action. Assume that we have an N4JS file with the following content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzJHzyKNMWo/XJTEE071AaI/AAAAAAAAAGY/Qk9KvQbtCbksypaUt-GtCB4K7HJmKR0LwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_simple_example.png&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzJHzyKNMWo/XJTEE071AaI/AAAAAAAAAGY/Qk9KvQbtCbksypaUt-GtCB4K7HJmKR0LwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_simple_example.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When the cursor is at &lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; of the constructor &lt;span&gt;new A()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;and we press Cmd + Shift + R to rename A to B, the rename refactoring suggests that it would rename A to B at 3 different locations. After entering the new name B and pressing enter, the class A and all its usages are renamed to B, fully automatically :-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Name conflicts detection &lt;/h3&gt;Renaming an element may cause name conflicts. The rename refactoring in N4JS IDE provides comprehensive checks for detecting name conflicts. If the new name would cause name conflicts, the rename refactoring is disallowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the example above,  renaming class A to class C would cause a name conflict because in the script scope the name C already exists. The rename refactoring provided by N4JS IDE can recognize this conflict and shows an error message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Um8f1tJZjo/XJS9OAQQx9I/AAAAAAAAAF4/GDRqLJkdf68TvRXI1Uh8SnxJVRSiXe_WACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_name_conflict.png&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Um8f1tJZjo/XJS9OAQQx9I/AAAAAAAAAF4/GDRqLJkdf68TvRXI1Uh8SnxJVRSiXe_WACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_name_conflict.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a large code base, these checks are a true life saver. Imagine having to manually verify these kinds of name conflicts across hundred of files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, N4JS IDE's rename refactoring is capable of recognizing name conflicts when renaming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;members of classifier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;formal parameters of a function or method&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;field of a structural type&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enum literal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;local variable, constant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;global variable, constant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rename composed members&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;N4JS language supports composed elements. Renaming a composed element is somewhat special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OdzTax12UZY/XKyF2jEua7I/AAAAAAAAAHs/tewAn07C-4QeuEnhUbWIcs1QTCpdmz6xACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_composed_member.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OdzTax12UZY/XKyF2jEua7I/AAAAAAAAAHs/tewAn07C-4QeuEnhUbWIcs1QTCpdmz6xACLcBGAs/s1600/rename_refactoring_composed_member.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this example, &lt;span&gt;ab.foo&lt;/span&gt; is a composed member because &lt;span&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt; is of the intersection type &lt;span&gt;A &amp;amp; B&lt;/span&gt; which is composed of both &lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;. Renaming &lt;span&gt;ab.foo&lt;/span&gt; would rename all the definitions that contribute to the creation of &lt;span&gt;ab.foo&lt;/span&gt; as well as all references of these definitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preview of changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;When you start rename refactoring operation, you have the possibility to see the preview of changes before actually executing the operation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OPewaTL2sJA/XKyGV4ooRpI/AAAAAAAAAH0/N9ruEVuNOEMNAESq45rOUFzkAJOS8naxwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename-refactoring-preview.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OPewaTL2sJA/XKyGV4ooRpI/AAAAAAAAAH0/N9ruEVuNOEMNAESq45rOUFzkAJOS8naxwCLcBGAs/s1600/rename-refactoring-preview.png&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Note that the preview shows the changes in each file in a very recognizable manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Undo changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the rename refactoring, if you feel regret and would like to undo the operation, simply press Cmd + Z. The undo will undo all the changes in affected files previously done by the rename refactoring.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Current limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;As the time of this writing, the rename refactoring in N4JS IDE still has several limitations:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Renaming alias is not supported&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking name conflicts do not take into account shadowing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;By Minh Quang Tran&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Specification Scope in Jakarta EE</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/?p=5558</guid>
	<link>https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2019/04/08/specification-scope-in-jakarta-ee/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Specification Process&lt;/a&gt; (EFSP) a single open source specification project has a dedicated project team of committers to create and maintain one or more specifications. The cycle of creation and maintenance extends across multiple versions of the specification, and so while individual members may come and go, the team remains and it is that team that is responsible for the every version of that specification that is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in managing how intellectual property rights flow through a specification is to define the range of the work encompassed by the specification. Per the Eclipse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Eclipse_IP_Policy.pdf&quot;&gt;Intellectual Property Policy&lt;/a&gt;, this range of work (referred to as the &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;) needs to be well-defined and captured. Once defined, the scope is effectively locked down (changes to the scope are possible but rare, and must be carefully managed; the scope of a specification can be tweaked and changed, but doing so requires approval from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Working Group’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-committee&quot;&gt;Specification Committee&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding scope, the EFSP states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other things, the Scope of a Specification Project is intended to inform companies and individuals so they can determine whether or not to contribute to the Specification. Since a change in Scope may change the nature of the contribution to the project, a change to a Specification Project’s Scope must be approved by a Super-majority of the Specification Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, a scope statement should not be too precise. Rather, it should describe the intention of the specification in broad terms. Think of the scope statement as an executive summary or “elevator pitch”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevator pitch: You have fifteen seconds before the elevator doors open on your floor; tell me about the problem your specification addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scope statement must answer the question: what does an implementation of this specification do? &lt;/span&gt;The scope statement must be aspirational rather than attempt to capture any particular state at any particular point-in-time. A scope statement must not focus on the work planned for any particular version of the specification, but rather, define the problem space that the specification is intended to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakarta Batch provides describes a means for executing and managing batch processes in Jakarta EE applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakarta Message Service describes a means for Jakarta EE applications to create, send, and receive messages via loosely coupled, reliable asynchronous communication services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the scope statement, you can assume that the reader has a rudimentary understanding of the field. It’s reasonable, for example, to expect the reader to understand what “batch processing” means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that the two examples presented above are just examples of form. I’m pretty sure that they make sense, but defer to the project teams to work with their communities to sort out the final form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope is “sticky” for the entire lifetime of the specification: it spans versions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-plans&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; for any particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-version-lifecycle&quot;&gt;development cycle&lt;/a&gt; must describe work that is &lt;em&gt;in scope&lt;/em&gt;; and at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-reviews&quot;&gt;checkpoint (progress and release) reviews&lt;/a&gt;, the project team must be prepared to demonstrate that the behavior described by the specifications (and tested by the corresponding TCK) cleanly &lt;em&gt;falls within&lt;/em&gt; the scope (note that the development life cycle of specification project is described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2019/03/08/eclipse-foundation-specification-process-step-by-step/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Specification Process Step-by-Step&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition the &lt;em&gt;specification&lt;/em&gt; scope which is required by the Eclipse Intellectual Property Policy and EFSP, the &lt;em&gt;specification project&lt;/em&gt; that owns and maintains the specification needs a &lt;em&gt;project scope&lt;/em&gt;. The project scope is, I think, pretty straightforward: a particular specification project defines and maintains a specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta Batch project defines and maintains the Jakarta Batch specification and related artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the specification scope, the project scope should be aspirational. In this regard, the specification project is responsible for the particular specification in perpetuity. Further the related artifacts, like APIs and TCKs can be &lt;em&gt;in scope&lt;/em&gt; without actually being managed by the project &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, for example, most of the TCKs for the Jakarta EE specifications are rolled into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-tck&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE TCK&lt;/a&gt; project. But, over time, this single monster TCK may be broken up and individual TCKs moved to corresponding specification projects. Or not. The point is that regardless of where the technical artifacts are currently maintained, they may one day be part of the specification project, so they are &lt;em&gt;in scope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should back up a bit and say that our intention right now is to turn the “Eclipse Project for …” projects that we have managing artifacts related to various specifications into actual specification projects. As part of this effort, we’ll add Git repositories to these projects to provide a home for the specification documents (more on this later). A handful of these proto-specification projects currently include artifacts related to multiple specifications, so we’ll have to sort out what we’re going to do about those project scope statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might consider, for example, changing the project scope of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-stable&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Stable APIs&lt;/a&gt; (note that I’m guessing a future new project name) to something simple like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakarta EE Stable APIs provides a home for stable (legacy) Jakarta EE specifications and related artifacts which are no longer actively developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, all that talk about specification projects aside, our initial focus needs to be on describing the scope of the specifications themselves. With that in mind, the EE4J PMC has created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-ee4j/projects/10&quot;&gt;project board&lt;/a&gt; with issues to track this work and we’re going to ask the project teams to start working with their communities to put these scope statements together. If you have thoughts regarding the scope statements for a particular specification, please weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we’re in a bit of a weird state right now. As we engage in a parallel effort to rename the specifications (and corresponding specification projects), it’s not entirely clear what we should call things. You’ll notice that the issues that have been created all use the names that we guess we’re going to end up using (there’s more more information about that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2019/04/04/renaming-java-ee-specifications-for-jakarta-ee/&quot;&gt;Renaming Java EE Specifications for Jakarta EE&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>N4JS: Develop a React app in N4JS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7569987920628430132.post-2700396086206641147</guid>
	<link>https://n4js.blogspot.com/2019/04/develop-react-app-in-n4js.html</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; is a popular JavaScript library created by Facebook widely used for developing web user interface. N4JS provides full support for React as well as the JavaScript extension &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/jsx/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JSX&lt;/a&gt; for describing UI elements. Internally, we have been using N4JS in combination with React and JSX for years to develop very large e-commerce web applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this blog post, we would like to show you the support of React and JSX in N4JS. In particular, we will implement the game Tic-tac-toe in N4JS. The implementation is heavily based on the pure JavaScript version in the tutorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tictactoe in React&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, we will focus on N4JS specifics as well as on the advantages of using N4JS over pure JavaScript.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As typical with Rect applications, the first step is to design a tree of React components to represent the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XiSxGN0f70A/XKYoXaGEjAI/AAAAAAAAAGw/0dz5lD3jDqwGKFD1ZNudKOMCbp9PhZJ5wCLcBGAs/s1600/tictactoe-react-components.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XiSxGN0f70A/XKYoXaGEjAI/AAAAAAAAAGw/0dz5lD3jDqwGKFD1ZNudKOMCbp9PhZJ5wCLcBGAs/s400/tictactoe-react-components.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root React component is Game that consists of two areas. The left area is the React component Board showing the Tic-tac-toe board while the right area shows the game information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;N4JS type definitions of React&lt;/h3&gt;In order to make use of N4JS's type checking for React, we need to declare &lt;span&gt;@n4jsd/react&lt;/span&gt; as dev dependency in &lt;span&gt;package.json&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;@n4jsd/react,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt; provided by us as a public npm,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;consists of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;n4jsd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt; files that contain file definitions for React.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;{&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&quot;tictactoe&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #931a68;&quot;&gt;&quot;devDependencies&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;: {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;@n4jsd/react&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;=16.6.*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot; style=&quot;color: #6c9fe9;&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6c9fe9;&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;dependencies&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;: {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot; style=&quot;color: #6c9fe9;&quot;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;react&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6c9fe9;&quot;&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;&quot;^16.6.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6c9fe9;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;                                        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;File extension n4jsx&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard file extension of N4JS is .n4js. N4JS files containing React and JSX must have the extension .n4jsx&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Square React component&lt;/h3&gt;The Square React component defines a single square of the Tic-tac-toe board that can be clicked by the current user. Its value is either &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;O or null &lt;/b&gt;depending on which user is in turn or if the square is empty. In this example, we define Square as a lightweight functional component since it does not have any state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;/**&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;* Square props&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*/&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; ~SquareProps &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;extends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;React.ComponentProps&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;public&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; value: &lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;public&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; onClick: &lt;/span&gt;{function():&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;void}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;/**&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;* Square React component&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*/&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; Square(props: &lt;/span&gt;SquareProps&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;): &lt;/span&gt;React.Element&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;return&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;button className=&lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;&quot;square&quot;&lt;/span&gt; onClick={props.onClick}&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;{props.value}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/div&gt;                   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The functional definition of Square must have a single &lt;span&gt;props&lt;/span&gt; parameter and return an instance of type &lt;span&gt;React.Element&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a &lt;span&gt;Square&lt;/span&gt; is instantiated, it expects two mandatory props described by &lt;span&gt;SquareProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;: the value of the square, either &lt;span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;O&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;: the event handler to be called when the square is clicked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;SquareProps&lt;/span&gt;, as any data structure describing props of a React component, must extend &lt;span&gt;React.ComponentProps&lt;/span&gt;. In addition to having explicit types, the props can be declared as mandatory (as in this example) or optional with the help of the question mark. For instance,  if you declared&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;public&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; value?: &lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; would be an optional prop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we start to see the advantages of N4JS over the pure non-type JavaScript implementation. When a Square component is created, the compiler will enforce the type of the props. Moreover, it will complain if a mandatory prop is missing. And all these checks happen &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;at compile time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. In pure JavaScript, we will recognize those mistakes only at runtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Board component&lt;/h3&gt;The Board React component represents the Tic-tac-toe board. Even though it does not have state, we define it as a class because it contains a helper method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;/**&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;* Board props&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*/&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; ~BoardProps &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;extends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;React.ComponentProps&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;public&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; squares: &lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;[string]&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;public&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;

Note that &lt;span&gt;React.Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt; expects two type arguments: the first type argument is the type of props and the second type argument is the type of state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, in the &lt;span&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; method we simply create 9 Squares that make up the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Game React component&lt;/h3&gt;This is the root React component of this application and hence does not have any props. Instead, it has state represented by &lt;span&gt;GameState&lt;/span&gt; which stores the history of the board, the step number and whether the next player is &lt;span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;/**&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;* Game state&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*/&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

In pure JavaScript, we will recognize those mistakes only at runtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Source code&lt;/h3&gt;You can find the source code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/qtran-n4/tictactoe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;                                                                                                                      By Minh Quang Tran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Renaming Java EE Specifications for Jakarta EE</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/?p=5559</guid>
	<link>https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2019/04/04/renaming-java-ee-specifications-for-jakarta-ee/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time to change the specification names…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first moved the APIs and TCKs for the Java EE specifications over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE&lt;/a&gt; banner, we kept the existing names for the specifications in place, and adopted placeholder names for the open source projects that hold their artifacts. As we prepare to engage in actual specification work (involving an actual specification document), it’s time to start thinking about changing the names of the specifications and the projects that contain their artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why change? For starters&lt;span&gt;, it’s just good form to leverage the Jakarta brand. But, more critically, m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;any of the existing specification names use trademarked terms that make it either very challenging or impossible to use those names without violating trademark rules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Motivation for changing the names of the existing open source projects that we’ll turn into specification projects is, I think, a little easier: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Eclipse Project for …” is a terrible name. So, while the current names for our proto-specification projects have served us well to-date, it’s time to change them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;To keep things simple, we recommend that we just use the name of the specification as the project name. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we’ve come up with a naming pattern that we believe can serve as a good starting point for discussion. To start with, in order to keep things as simple as possible, we’ll have the project use the same name as the specification (unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naming rules are relatively simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace “Java” with “Jakarta” (e.g. “Java Message Service”&lt;span&gt; becomes “Jakarta Message Service”);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a space in cases where names are mashed together (e.g. “JavaMail” becomes “Jakarta Mail”);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add “Jakarta” when it is missing (e.g. “Expression Language” becomes “Jakarta Expression Language”); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rework names to consistently start with “Jakarta” (“Enterprise JavaBeans” becomes “Jakarta Enterprise Beans”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presents us with an opportunity to add even more consistency to the various specification names. Some, for example, are more wordy or descriptive than others; some include the term “API” in the name, and others don’t; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have to sort out what we’re going to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-stable&quot;&gt;Eclipse Project for Stable Jakarta EE Specifications&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a home for a small handful of specifications which are not expected to change. I’ll personally be happy if we can at least drop the “Eclipse Project for” from the name&lt;span&gt; (“Jakarta EE Stable”?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We’ll also have to sort out what we’re going to do about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.mojarra&quot;&gt;Eclipse Mojarra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.metro&quot;&gt;Eclipse Metro&lt;/a&gt; projects which hold the APIs for some specifications; we may end up having to create new specification projects as homes for development of the corresponding specification documents (regardless of how this ends up manifesting as a specification project, we’re still going to need specification names).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on all of the above, here is my suggested &lt;em&gt;starting point&lt;/em&gt; for specification (and most project) names (I’ve applied the rules described above; and have suggested tweaks for consistency by &lt;del&gt;strike out&lt;/del&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;APIs&lt;/del&gt; for XML Messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;Architecture for&lt;/del&gt; XML Binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;API for&lt;/del&gt; XML&lt;del&gt;-based&lt;/del&gt; Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Common Annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Enterprise Beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Persistence &lt;del&gt;API&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta EE Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;API for&lt;/del&gt; JSON Binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Servlet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;API for&lt;/del&gt; RESTful Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Server Faces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;API for&lt;/del&gt; JSON Processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;EE&lt;/del&gt; Security &lt;del&gt;API&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Bean Validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Beans Activation &lt;del&gt;Framework&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Debugging Support for Other Languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Server Pages Standard Tag Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta EE Platform Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta EE Platform Application Deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;API for&lt;/del&gt; XML Registries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;API for&lt;/del&gt; XML-based RPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Enterprise Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Authorization &lt;del&gt;Contract for Containers&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Web Services Metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Authentication &lt;del&gt;Service Provider Interface for Containers&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Concurrency Utlities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Server Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Connector Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Dependency Injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Expression Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Message Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Batch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta &lt;del&gt;API for&lt;/del&gt; WebSocket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jakarta Transaction &lt;del&gt;API&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to couple renaming with an effort to capture proper scope statements (I’ll cover this in my next post). The Eclipse EE4J PMC Lead, Ivar Grimstad, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilejava.eu/2019/03/18/jakarta-ee-8-status/&quot;&gt;blogged about this recently&lt;/a&gt; and has created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-ee4j/projects/11&quot;&gt;project board&lt;/a&gt; to track the specification and project renaming activity (as of this writing, it has only just been started, so watch that space). We’ll start reaching out to the “Eclipse Project for …”  teams shortly to start engaging this process. When we’ve collected all of the information (names and scopes), we’ll engage in a restructuring review per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Development Process&lt;/a&gt; (EDP) and make it all happen (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your input is requested. I’ll monitor comments on this post, but it would be better to collect your thoughts in the issues listed on the project board (after we’ve taken the step to create them, of course), on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/issues/50&quot;&gt;related issue&lt;/a&gt;, or on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/ee4j-pmc&quot;&gt;EE4J PMC’s mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Tanja Obradovic: How to participate in advancing Jakarta EE Specification: Technical and Collateral material related work</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.eclipse.org/6688 at https://blogs.eclipse.org</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/tanja-obradovic/how-participate-advancing-jakarta-ee-specification-technical-and-collateral</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ntDKfTQE_k7haiRm3hR_juSyUyLcSTHGy096zSBF_pYMb6URdzISoxze3MRKPzqtMNpMtPcg5lVz9VAzNLUH0z5ZxJzYfoAePMFgC2sEZ3OwdmWzVKTrlHu5wsw4W84m6lyeI0sT&quot; style=&quot;height: 219px; width: 624px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We will need a lot of help on this front as well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;o   Jakarta EE specifications: specification documents and APIs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have heard from members of the community some suggestions on what they need from the specification, but we can always use more. Get involved in the discussion on Github (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues&quot;&gt;https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;o   Jakarta EE TCK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It’s a goliath, inconvenient, and we want to slowly begin to break it up into separate TCKs for each specification. Not for the very first release of Jakarta EE, but we need to start planning and discussing the approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;o   Compatible Implementations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To make a final version of a specification alive we need specification implementations. Whether the implementation is hosted in Eclipse Foundation or not is not the focus, we need you to implement the specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/f6fah-CYgdOPLv1jyee9HuhJwbhEAnbp1ntN6YgCT4FTu9zn100i0JxZOwDL5nXd0arh9XI_rZCNgBk6an0n72WCuTnprR531aMsy_cICVUH9wutZIOtd5L0juPcQP8sBcOjE4Ty&quot; style=&quot;height: 209px; width: 597px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collateral material related work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;While we encourage everyone to participate in specification development, please keep in mind this isn’t limited to coding only. Of equal importance is the need for collateral material related to the specification(s). This includes documentation, presentations, videos, demos, examples, blogs, tech talks, etc. This is the type of content we can circulate through the community and use to educate and spread the news on the new specifications. Presenting the material on the conferences is yet another aspect where you can help out also!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-blog-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/blog-tags/jakartaee&quot;&gt;#JakartaEE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/blog-tags/javaee&quot;&gt;#JavaEE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/blog-tags/communitywork&quot;&gt;#CommunityWork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/blog-tags/java-0&quot;&gt;#Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>vert.x project: Eclipse Vert.x 3.7.0 released!</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://vertx.io/blog/eclipse-vert-x-3-7-0-released</guid>
	<link>https://vertx.io/blog/eclipse-vert-x-3-7-0-released</link>
	<description>&lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are extremely pleased to announce that the Eclipse Vert.x version 3.7.0 has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an exciting milestone for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it comes with great new features like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vertx.io/feed.xml#vertx-web-graphql&quot;&gt;GraphQL extension for Vert.x Web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is the last minor version before Vert.x 4! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go throught the most notable new features, we would like to thank all the contributors.
Your participation has been essential to this achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;-a-id-vertx-web-graphql-vert-x-web-graphql-a-&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;vertx-web-graphql&quot;&gt;Vert.x Web GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vert.x Web GraphQL extends Vert.x Web with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graphql-java.com&quot;&gt;GraphQL-Java&lt;/a&gt; library so that you can build a GraphQL server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this new module, add the following to the &lt;em&gt;dependencies&lt;/em&gt; section of your Maven POM file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;groupId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;io.vertx&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;groupId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;vertx-web-graphql&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;3.7.0&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if you use Gradle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'io.vertx:vertx-web-graphql:3.7.0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then create a Vert.x Web &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;GraphQLHandler&lt;/code&gt; for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Setup the GraphQL-Java object&lt;/span&gt;
GraphQL graphQL = setupGraphQLJava();
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Use it to handle requests on a Vert.x Web route &lt;/span&gt;
router.route(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;/graphql&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).handler(GraphQLHandler.create(graphQL));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GraphQL handler supports out of the box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;query context customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GraphQL-Java data loaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;batching on &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests (compatible with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/batch-http.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;apollo-link-batch-http&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; transport)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-graphql/java/&quot;&gt;Vert.x Web GraphQL documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;vert-x-cassandra-client&quot;&gt;Vert.x Cassandra Client&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;object-mapper-support&quot;&gt;Object mapper support&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vert.x Cassandra Client now supports the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/tree/3.x/manual/object_mapper&quot;&gt;cassandra-driver-mapping&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable this feature, you need to update your classpath by adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;groupId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.datastax.cassandra&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;groupId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;cassandra-driver-mapping&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;3.7.1&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then for a given entity: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-annotation&quot;&gt;@Table&lt;/span&gt;(keyspace = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, name = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;users&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-class&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-annotation&quot;&gt;@PartitionKey&lt;/span&gt; String name;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// ... other fields and methods &lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can retrieve a mapper and execute CRUD operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;VertxMappingManager manager = VertxMappingManager.create(cassandraClient);
VertxMapper mapper = manager.mapper(User.class, vertx);
mapper.save(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; User(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;john&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, hander -&amp;gt; {}));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;collector-api&quot;&gt;Collector API&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature allows to use Java &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collector.html&quot;&gt;collectors&lt;/a&gt; for query results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Create a collector projecting a row set to a string in the form (last_name_1,last_name_2,...)&lt;/span&gt;
Collector collector = Collectors.mapping(
    row -&amp;gt; row.getString(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;last_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;),
    Collectors.joining(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;(&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
);

&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Run the query with the collector&lt;/span&gt;
client.execute(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, collector, ar -&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ar.succeeded()) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Result in the form (last_name_1,last_name_2,...)&lt;/span&gt;
    String result = ar.result();
  } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
    System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Failure: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;cursor-api&quot;&gt;Cursor API&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ResultSet&lt;/code&gt; object has been enhanced with &lt;code&gt;ResultSet#several&lt;/code&gt; method, allowing you to obtain several rows at once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;resultSet.several(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;, ar -&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ar.succeeded()) {
    List result = ar.result();
  } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
    System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Failure: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very useful feature for result batch iterations without resorting to streaming or fetching all rows in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;client-lifecyle&quot;&gt;Client lifecyle&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client lifecyle has been revisited in 3.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously users expected to &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt; manually before sending requests. It was also possible to &lt;code&gt;disconnect&lt;/code&gt; a shared client
thus failing requests sent from another verticle or part of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is no longer required to manually connect a client (in fact, the method has been removed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you retrieve an instance you can start using it, the lifecyle is automatically managed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;CassandraClientOptions options = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; CassandraClientOptions()
  .addContactPoint(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;node1.address&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  .addContactPoint(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;node2.address&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  .addContactPoint(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;node3.address&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  .setKeyspace(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;my_keyspace&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
CassandraClient sharedClient = CassandraClient.createShared(vertx, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;sharedClientName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, options);
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Start sending requests to Cassandra with the client instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when the new &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; method is invoked on a shared client, only the last active instance will actually disconnect from Cassandra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Disconnects only if this is the last running instance of the shared client&lt;/span&gt;
sharedClient.close();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vert-x-redis-client&quot;&gt;Vert.x Redis Client&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vert.x Redis client has been reworked internally and provides now a new (more evolution friendly) API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current API had the limitation of being manually crafted after the redis API and involved many non controlable features
such as auto reconnect, unlimited buffering of requests, etc… The new API offers a more &lt;em&gt;vert.x-y&lt;/em&gt; experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just exposes the base client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;Redis
  .createClient(vertx, inetSocketAddress(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;7006&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))
  .connect(create -&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; Redis redis = create.result();

    redis.send(Request.cmd(Command.PING), send -&amp;gt; {
      &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// ... should reply with PONG&lt;/span&gt;
    });
  });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the benefits that you can now connect to Redis in any of it’s operation modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HA mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API is decoupled from the handcrafted commands, which means that you can use new features such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/commands#stream&quot;&gt;streams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/commands#hyperloglog&quot;&gt;hyperloglog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RedisLabsModules&quot;&gt;any extension module&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generated helper &lt;code&gt;RedisAPI&lt;/code&gt; is available that can wrap the client to provide a similar experience to the old API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference is that this new wrapper is generated from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/commands/command&quot;&gt;COMMAND&lt;/a&gt; command,
so the correct API it always exposed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;RedisAPI redis = RedisAPI.api(client);

redis.set(Arrays.asList(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;key1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;value1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;), set -&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vert-x-amqp-client&quot;&gt;Vert.x AMQP Client&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vert.x AMQP client allows receiving and sending AMQP messages. It supersedes the current AMQP bridge and provide an API more
flexible and very much user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vert.x AMQP client allows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to an AMQP broker or router - SASL and TLS connections are supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consuming message from a queue or a topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending messages to a queue or a topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking acknowledgement for sent messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMQP 1.0 protocol support durable subscriptions, persistence, security, conversations, sophisticated routing… More
 details on the protocol can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amqp.org/&quot;&gt;AMQP homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vert.x AMQP client is based on Vert.x Proton. If you need fine-grain control, we recommend using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-proton&quot;&gt;Vert.x Proton&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this new module, add the following to the &lt;em&gt;dependencies&lt;/em&gt; section of your Maven POM file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;groupId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;io.vertx&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;groupId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;vertx-amqp-client&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;3.7.0&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if you use Gradle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'io.vertx:vertx-amqp-client:3.7.0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you can connect to an AMQP broker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;AmqpClientOptions options = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; AmqpClientOptions()
      .setHost(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;localhost&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
      .setPort(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;5672&lt;/span&gt;)
      .setUsername(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
      .setPassword(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;secret&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);

AmqpClient client = AmqpClient.create(vertx, options);

client.connect(ar -&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ar.failed()) {
    System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Unable to connect to the broker&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
  } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
    System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Connection succeeded&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
    AmqpConnection connection = ar.result();

    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// You can create receivers and senders&lt;/span&gt;
    connection.createReceiver(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-queue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
      msg -&amp;gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// called on every received messages&lt;/span&gt;
        System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Received &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + msg.bodyAsString());
      },
      done -&amp;gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (done.failed()) {
          System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Unable to create receiver&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
        } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
          AmqpReceiver receiver = done.result();
        }
      }
    );

    connection.createSender(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-queue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, done -&amp;gt; {
      &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (done.failed()) {
        System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Unable to create a sender&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
      } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
        AmqpSender sender = done.result();
        sender.send(AmqpMessage.create().withBody(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).build());
      }
    });

  }
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stream-pipes&quot;&gt;Stream pipes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to streaming, back-pressure is something you need to care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have very much likely heard or used the Vert.x &lt;code&gt;Pump&lt;/code&gt; API to transfer data from a read stream to a write stream while
respecting the write stream back-pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Pipe&lt;/code&gt; a new API superseding the &lt;code&gt;Pump&lt;/code&gt; to achieve the same effect and even more, it acts like a pump and handles for you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read stream pause/resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write stream termination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stream failures handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asynchronous result upon streaming completion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can transfer a read stream to a write stream simply, the write stream will be ended upon completion of the stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;readStream.pipeTo(writeStream);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also be notified when the pipe completes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;readStream.pipeTo(writeStream, ar -&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ar.succeeded()) {
    System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;done&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
  } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
    System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;failed &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + ar.cause());
  }
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating and using an asynchronous pipe is easy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// The read stream will be paused until the pipe is used&lt;/span&gt;
Pipe pipe = readStream.pipe();
getAsyncPipe(ar -&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ar.succeeded()) {
    pipe.to(writeStream);
  } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
    pipe.close();
  }
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kafka-admin-client&quot;&gt;Kafka admin client&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version brings a Vert.x based first implementation of the native &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#adminapi&quot;&gt;Kafka Admin Client API&lt;/a&gt;
which are in Java, instead of Scala used in the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;AdminUtils&lt;/code&gt; is now deprecated and the new &lt;code&gt;KafkaAdminClient&lt;/code&gt; is available instead.
It allows to remove the last Scala artifact dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code&gt;AdminUtils&lt;/code&gt; implementation needs to connect to Zookeeper for administration purposes,
the &lt;code&gt;KafkaAdminClient&lt;/code&gt; only uses the Kafka bootstrap brokers connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs java&quot;&gt;Properties config = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Properties();
config.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-kafka-broker:9092&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);

KafkaAdminClient adminClient = KafkaAdminClient.create(vertx, config);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features currently supported are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create and delete topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;list all the topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe topics for getting information about leader partition, follower replicas and ISR (in-sync replicas) list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alter topics configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;list all consumer groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe consumer groups for getting information like the state, the coordinator host, consumers per topics and so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using the &lt;code&gt;AdminUtils&lt;/code&gt; today, consider migrate to the new &lt;code&gt;KafkaAdminClient&lt;/code&gt; because the former will be removed in Vert.x 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;and-more-&quot;&gt;And more…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other important improvements you can find in this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared data structures available in local-only mode even when Vert.x is clustered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON decoding without prior knowledge of the structure (object, array, string, …etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infinispan Cluster Manager upgraded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://infinispan.org&quot;&gt;Infinispan&lt;/a&gt; 9.4.10.Final&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And obviously we have the usual bug fixes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;finally&quot;&gt;Finally&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.7.0-Release-Notes&quot;&gt;3.7.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the wiki, as well as the
list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.7.0-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes&quot;&gt;deprecations and breaking changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker images are available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/u/vertx/&quot;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vert.x distribution can be downloaded on the website but is also available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdkman.io/index.html&quot;&gt;SDKMan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;HomeBrew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event bus client using the SockJS bridge is available from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/vertx3-eventbus-client&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-bus-bower&quot;&gt;Bower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webjars.org/&quot;&gt;WebJars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release artifacts have been deployed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.vertx%22%20AND%20v%3A%223.7.0%22&quot;&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt; and you can get the distribution on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/3.7.0/view&quot;&gt;Bintray&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev &lt;a href=&quot;https://vertx.io/community&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://tools.jboss.org/blog/12.11.0.ga.html</link>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/2019-03/4.11.0.Final.html&quot;&gt;JBoss Tools 4.11.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/downloads/devstudio/2019-03/12.11.0.GA.html&quot;&gt;Red Hat CodeReady Studio 12.11&lt;/a&gt; for Eclipse 2019-03 are here waiting for you. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;crstudio12&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/crstudio12.png&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/overview/&quot;&gt;Red Hat CodeReady product page&lt;/a&gt; and run it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;java -jar devstudio-&amp;lt;installername&amp;gt;.jar&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This release requires at least Eclipse 4.11 (2019-03) but we recommend
      using the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers&quot;&gt;Eclipse 4.11 2019-03 JEE Bundle&lt;/a&gt; since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under &quot;JBoss Tools&quot; or &quot;Red Hat CodeReady Studio&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-new&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#what-is-new&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is new?&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our main focus for this release was improvements for container based development and bug fixing.
      Eclipse 2019-03 itself has a lot of new cool stuff but let me highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2019-03 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3 id=&quot;openshift-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#openshift-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OpenShift 3&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4 id=&quot;new-openshift-connection-helper&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#new-openshift-connection-helper&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New OpenShift connection helper&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When you need to defined a new OpenShift connection, you need to provide the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;cluster URL&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;username and password or token&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you’ve already logged in your cluster through the OpenShift Web Console, you can copy an &lt;code&gt;oc&lt;/code&gt; command
      in the clipboard that contains both the cluster URL and your token.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So, from now, there is a new option that allows you to initialize the wizard fields from the copied &lt;code&gt;oc&lt;/code&gt;
      command:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;connection wizard paste&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/connection-wizard-paste.png&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;Paste Login Command&lt;/code&gt; button and the fields will be initialized:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;connection wizard paste1&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/connection-wizard-paste1.png&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3 id=&quot;server-tools&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#server-tools&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Server tools&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A server adapter has been added to work with EAP 7.2.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4 id=&quot;wildfly-15-server-adapter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#wildfly-15-server-adapter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wildfly 15 Server Adapter&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 15. It adds support for Java EE 8.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The new Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider has been added. It incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.1.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.1.Final&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.9.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.9.Final.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      tab which can be used to exclude some resources from Project Explorer based on their name.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Error Log&lt;/strong&gt; view has been moved from the PDE project to the Platform project. See
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=50517&quot;&gt;bug 50517&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A copy to clipboard action has been added to all tabs of the &lt;strong&gt;Installation Details&lt;/strong&gt; dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Environment&lt;/strong&gt; tab in a &lt;strong&gt;Launch configuration&lt;/strong&gt; dialog supports copy &amp;amp; paste actions now. The environment
      variables are transferred as text data, so it is not only possible to copy &amp;amp; paste between two different
      launch configurations, but also between the launch configuration and e.g. some text editor or the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This feature is available in all launch configurations which use the common &lt;strong&gt;Environment&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Dark theme for Mac has been improved to use the colors from the macOS system dark appearance. Some of the
      notable changes in Eclipse IDE are the dark window title bar, menus, file dialogs, combos and buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: This change is available on macOS Mojave and later.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The drawing operations have been improved in Windows so the custom drawn icons look better now.

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Instead of a single line wrapping setting for binary expressions, there’s now a whole section of settings
      for various kinds of &lt;strong&gt;binary operators&lt;/strong&gt; (multiplicative, additive, logical, etc.). There are settings
      for &lt;em&gt;relational&lt;/em&gt; (including equality) and &lt;em&gt;shift&lt;/em&gt; operators, which were not covered by the old setting.
      Also, &lt;em&gt;string concatenation&lt;/em&gt; can now be treated differently from arithmetic sum.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The settings can be found in the Profile Editor (&lt;strong&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Java &amp;gt; Code Style &amp;gt; Formatter &amp;gt; Edit…​&lt;/strong&gt;)

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The white space around operators in &lt;strong&gt;binary expressions&lt;/strong&gt; can now be controlled separately for different groups
      of operators, consistent with the line wrapping settings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The new &lt;strong&gt;Binary operators&lt;/strong&gt; sub-section has been added under White Space &amp;gt; Expressions in the Formatter

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A chain of &lt;em&gt;nested conditional expressions&lt;/em&gt; (using ternary operator) can be now wrapped as a single group,
      with all of them indented at the same level. It’s only possible for right-sided nesting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Formatter Profile has a new setting that indents wrapped Javadoc tag descriptions.
      It’s called &lt;em&gt;Indent other tag descriptions when wrapped&lt;/em&gt;, in contrast to the preexisting &lt;em&gt;Indent wrapped
      @param/@throws descriptions&lt;/em&gt; setting. It affects tags like &lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;@return&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;@deprecated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Donald Raab: Our journey to 1000 GitHub stars and commits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/efa442bf3603</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/@donraab/our-journey-to-1000-github-stars-and-commits-efa442bf3603?source=rss-df39b86e9f04------2</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Taking note of an important milestone, how we got here, and where we go next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c2lR0FCHgmwdl_SWPP1jGQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; became a reality at the Eclipse Foundation at the end of 2015. We had successfully migrated GS Collections to the Eclipse Foundation to become Eclipse Collections. An announcement was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/01/GS-Collections-Eclipse-Foundn&quot;&gt;published at InfoQ in January 2016&lt;/a&gt; on the migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;By partnering with the Eclipse Foundation, we hope to grow a vibrant and open community of contributors and committers around the Eclipse Collections project.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GS Collections project had only allowed contributions from Goldman Sachs developers. At the Eclipse Foundation, anyone can contribute to the Eclipse Collections project as long as they sign the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php&quot;&gt;Eclipse Contributor Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the move to the Eclipse Foundation, GS Collections had reached 1400 stars on GitHub. After three years of hard work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/collections/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; has reached the milestone of 1000 GitHub stars. I marked the milestone in Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/605/1*uocRVs2CcbqJXMmTFc4YqA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 49 contributors so far, we are realizing our dream of building a vibrant and open community around Eclipse Collections. Contributors are welcome &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We started from zero stars three years ago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although GS Collections is no longer actively developed, it has continued growing from 1400 stars in 2016 to over 1700 on GitHub today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/785/1*x8iY3Xv-l8QP5yKFxwN5CA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Collections started at zero stars in 2016 and passed the 1000 star milestone earlier this month. This has been thanks to the support of our growing community. We are fortunate to have some motivated and inspirational Eclipse Collections advocates who help us raise awareness by acting as information radiators and amplifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/783/1*I2ujSELCUYEY_Cg80Mzt1Q.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk at the Open Source Strategy Forum in 2017 which explained some of the things we have done to help increase awareness of Eclipse Collections. The title of the talk was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensourcestrategyforum.org/talks/cant-hear-mute/&quot;&gt;They Can’t Hear You On Mute&lt;/a&gt;.” It took a lot more than this to get us here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;There is no “I” in Open Source.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got where we are today because we worked hard to build a community of energized contributors and vocal advocates. The success of Eclipse Collections has been driven by the support of its vibrant and open developer community. The first thing we had to do was build this community from the ground floor. We actively encourage developers to contribute to the project in numerous ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have promoted the approach of using code katas for learning and teaching the framework. The code katas for Eclipse Collections can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. One of the greatest contributions someone can make to a framework is to learn it, use it and then to teach it to others. The Eclipse Collections Kata was taught recently at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/dublin-java-user-group/Eclipse-Collections-Kata-Barry-Evans/&quot;&gt;Dublin Java User Group meet-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/604/1*8m1L5D6OXahAEIuN2XIvhQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching is the best way to learn, and a great way to contribute. Thank you to all the teachers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen multiple blogs and articles written by members of the community, in addition to many tweets. We continue to make rounds at conferences and Java User Group meet-ups, and are happy to hand out Eclipse Collections stickers to anyone who wants one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every little bit helps. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to our success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You can’t get there from here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committers on the project balance their day jobs with engaging with the open source Java community at tech conferences, on Twitter, writing blogs and articles, reviewing issues and pull requests, and occasionally adding new features to the framework. Our role as committers has changed significantly from the days when we were primarily contributors and our focus was to write code we needed for the projects we worked on. Our job now is to raise awareness, provide training, increase adoption, encourage and promote the contributions of others, and continue to build the community. We are actively looking out for developers who are interested in vesting themselves in the framework to the level at which they can become the next committers on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can become a Committer and even Project Lead on an open source project if you set that as a goal and demonstrate you are vested in supporting the project. Below is a link to a great blog post which explains the process of becoming a Committer on an open source project at the Eclipse Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/the-eclipse-committer-election-workflow/&quot;&gt;https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/the-eclipse-committer-election-workflow/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Thank you to everyone in the community&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We received our 1000th commit on the same day that we reached 1000 stars on GitHub. Thank you to our entire Eclipse Collections developer community for helping us reach this second amazing milestone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1003/1*T6At97Vi2xtq5uDp7IFsyw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the activity in Eclipse Collections since the beginning, you will see a fairly steady flow of work being contributed by our amazing community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/755/1*gX2ugFubsUdsE3G6_dsidA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a nice milestone to have now passed 1000 commits, and it was cool to unlock this achievement on the same day we passed 1000 stars. I gave a shout out on Twitter to the developer who helped us pass this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/604/1*VY59WgQ5G-DtXZjoMP97CQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all of the contributors who helped Eclipse Collections reach 1000 commits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Open source will surprise you&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the greatest surprise contribution from the open source community came in the form of Jackson serialization support for Eclipse Collections types in the jackson-datatypes-collections project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatypes-collections&quot;&gt;FasterXML/jackson-datatypes-collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an amazing contribution to all users of Eclipse Collections who also use the Jackson library for serialization support. We literally did not see this contribution coming, until it arrived. I had hoped someone would be interested in providing this support, and I am very thankful to the developer who worked on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatypes-collections&quot;&gt;Star this repo&lt;/a&gt; if you use a third-party collections library and benefit from the the Jackson serialization support provided by one of the amazing developers who contribute their time and energy to make our lives as developers easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We sent some Eclipse Collections mugs and stickers to the developer who made this awesome contribution to the open source Java community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/607/1*rrjoQPuyg5qm3Vu3Jp-4-Q.png&quot; /&gt;Be willing to be surprised, and remember to say thank you.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s next for Eclipse Collections?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re hoping to see our 50th, 60th, and maybe 100th contributor, and our 6th, 7th and maybe even 10th committer by the end of 2019. We appreciate contributions of any kind. No contribution is too small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d also like to pass 2000 stars in 2019. We can’t get there without further building our community, so expect to see some energized Eclipse Collections advocates presenting at technical conferences and Java User Group meet-ups throughout 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be releasing version 10.0 of the project in the next few months. The project has become stable enough that we have not done a major release since September 2017. The addition of default methods in Java 8 has made it possible for us to safely release API changes in minor releases, so the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@donraab/eclipse-collections-9-1-released-24c413d200ec&quot;&gt;9.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/oracledevs/eclipse-collections-9-2-released-aa88b56ecacc&quot;&gt;9.2&lt;/a&gt; releases had quite a few new APIs added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One last thank you for the journey ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Collections is an open source project built by an amazing developer community for an amazing developer community. We love Java, and we are thankful to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for giving us a great place to build our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all those that have helped the project reach this stage in its evolution. Thank you to all those that continue to help us as we move the project forward and as we look to build our community further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this blog reaches developers out there who have been interested in joining an open source community and making their first contribution. We are here and happy to help you take that first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is open for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;contributions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. If you like the library, you can let us know by starring it on GitHub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=efa442bf3603&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Fabio Zadrozny: LiClipse 5.2.2 released</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7855001383687474475.post-5274877453732983738</guid>
	<link>http://liclipse.blogspot.com/2019/03/liclipse-522-released.html</link>
	<description>This version does an updated of the main dependencies of LiClipse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's now based on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eclipse 4.11 (also named 2019-03)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PyDev (5.2.2) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EGit (5.3.0)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;As a note, it seems I haven't updated this blog as often as I should (I end up putting more effort into announcing the PyDev updates) but just to note, LiClipse is always updated whenever PyDev is updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>Thabang Mashologu: Thank You for Taking the Jakarta EE 2019 Developer Survey!</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.eclipse.org/6684 at https://blogs.eclipse.org</guid>

The survey wrapped up at midnight on Monday, March 25, with&lt;strong&gt; over 1,770 responses&lt;/strong&gt; from developers around the globe. Truly an outstanding response from an amazing community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you all for taking the time to participate in this year’s survey. We greatly appreciate your valuable input on enterprise and cloud native application development trends, priorities, and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We look forward to sharing the key findings and insights from your survey responses. The results will be published in late April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Stay tuned and thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;
